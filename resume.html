              <h3>Fantasy Football Draft Board</h3>
              <p>After years of failing to find success in my Fantasy Football league, it was time to make a change in how I drafted players every year. Using data from the NFL, I wanted to see who the top performers were the pervious year, and graphed the total points scored in 2021. However it's not just about points scored, consistency is important too! By measuring how consistent a player performed, I could draft to avoid players who either boom or bust, and have confidence that I'll have a winning chance every week. Additionally included is the 2022 Average Draft Position (ADP) to highlight the consensus thinking, and a method to track players who have already been drafted, who is on a watchlist, and positions that have already been filled.</p>

              <h3>Smart Review</h3>
              <p>Doing your own taxes is never fun. It should come as no surprise that doing taxes for other people can be a bit of a drag. And after days and months of looking at numbers in a spreadsheet, it's easy to make a mistake when checking to make sure you entered in everything correctly. While working at PwC, I built an automated Alteryx workflow that would instantly review preparred tax forms to ensure everything was filled out correctly. Any mistakes or errors would be flagged for immediate review and action, while also showing what parts of the form were filled in correctly. With this workflow and visualization, tax preparers could focus their time on correcting forms and solving real problems, without spending time sifting through the documents and forms that were error-free</p>

              <h3>Income Tax Calculator</h3>
              <p>As a tool to learn Python, I developed a script that would ask the user a few basic questions such as their marital status, taxable income, and the year they were filing, to calculate their income tax liability. The script would pull from a basic table on GitHub that contained the various tax brackets and the associated rates.</p>
              <p>Once all the inputs have been collected, the python script will calculate the income tax liability using the progressive tax brackets for the appropriate year and filing status.</p>

              <p>Lead developer for the a collection of Alteryx focused workflows that automatted the tax review process for tax forms including Form 1065, Form 1120, and Form 1120-S. The single workflow reviews over 200 line items per return, standardizing the initial rewiew steps across the practice. As a result, senior accounts were free to focus on unique client situations while ensuring any basic mistakes would be caught immediately. The workflow outputted multiple Excel and Tableau files for users to review in whichever manner they were most comfortable with.</p>

              <p>Additionally, our team developed a simple, yet powerful analytic app to help users compare trial balances. Often individuals would spend hours comparing two different trial balances from their client, looking for changes. Often these changes were missed, while other times a change in the account name was falsely flagged for review. With our Trial Balance Comparison tool, an associate could quickly compare two trial balances and understand the difference.</p>
